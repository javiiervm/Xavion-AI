  <h1 align="center">ü§ñ AI Chatbot with GODEL ü§ñ</h1>
</div>

A local, knowledge-aware conversational AI chatbot powered by [Microsoft GODEL](https://github.com/microsoft/GODEL). This chatbot runs entirely on your machine, supports structured prompts, and can reference custom knowledge stored in a local database.
<br /><br />

## üìå Features

* Based on Microsoft's `GODEL-v1_1-base-seq2seq` model (via Hugging Face)
* Works offline once the model is downloaded
* Uses structured prompts with `instruction`, `fact`, and `conversation` blocks
* Supports custom external knowledge from a JSON knowledge base
* Responds dynamically to the user and adapts based on detected context
* Easily extendable with your own facts, logic, or integrations

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Virtual environment (recommended)
* Internet (only for initial model download)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone the repo and set up your environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/godel-chatbot.git
cd godel-chatbot
python -m venv chatbot-env
source chatbot-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: chatbot-env\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the chatbot:

```bash
python main.py
```

## üí¨ Example Usage

```
>> What is Python?
ü§ñ: Python is a high-level programming language used for AI, automation, and data science.

>> Who is Pepe?
ü§ñ: Pepe is a friend of the user. He loves science fiction and has a black cat.

>> Hi!
ü§ñ: Hello! How can I help you today?
```

## üß† How Knowledge Works

The chatbot uses a local file `data/knowledge_base.json` to look up facts based on keywords in the user's message.

Example entry:

```json
{
  "python": "Python is a high-level programming language used for AI, automation, and data science.",
  "pepe": "Pepe is a friend of the user. He loves science fiction and has a black cat."
}
```

You can expand this file with your own knowledge entries. The chatbot will automatically include the most relevant fact in its response generation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Configuration

In `logic.py`, you can tweak generation parameters like:

* `max_length`
* `do_sample` (for creativity)
* `num_beams` (for precision)
* `temperature`, `top_p` (when sampling is enabled)

## üìö Resources Used

* [Microsoft GODEL GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/GODEL)
* [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers)
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [HuggingFace Model Hub: microsoft/GODEL-v1\_1-base-seq2seq](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/GODEL-v1_1-base-seq2seq)

## üîß TODO / Future Improvements

* [ ] Add memory management for multi-turn conversations
* [ ] Integrate semantic search using sentence-transformers
* [ ] Add support for API-based knowledge retrieval (Wikipedia, Wolfram Alpha, etc.)
* [ ] Export logs of conversations for analysis or training
