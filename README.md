<br /><br />

A local, knowledge-aware conversational AI chatbot powered by [Microsoft GODEL](https://github.com/microsoft/GODEL). This chatbot runs entirely on your machine, supports structured prompts, and can reference custom knowledge stored in a local database.
<br /><br />

## Features

* Based on Microsoft's `GODEL-v1_1-large-seq2seq` model (via Hugging Face)
* Works offline once the model is downloaded
* Uses structured prompts with `instruction`, `knowledge`, and `conversation_history` blocks
* Supports custom external knowledge and dynamic learning using a JSON knowledge base
* Responds dynamically to the user and adapts based on detected context
* Easily extendable with your own facts, logic, or integrations

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+  *(Program has been tested with Python 3.13)*
* Virtual Python environment to install packages (recommended, not mandatory)
* Internet access (not mandatory when using the model offline)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo and set up your environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/javiiervm/Xavion-AI.git
cd Python-AI-chatbot
python -m venv chatbot-env
source chatbot-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: chatbot-env\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the [GODEL large model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/GODEL-v1_1-large-seq2seq) and place the `GODEL-v1_1-large-seq2seq` folder in the same directory as `main.py` (for offline use).

4. Run the chatbot:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Example Usage

```
>> What is Python?
ðŸ¤– Python is a high-level programming language used for AI, automation, and data science.

>> Who is Pepe?
ðŸ¤– Pepe is a friend of the user. He loves science fiction and has a black cat.

>> Hi!
ðŸ¤– Hello! How can I help you today?
```

## How Knowledge Works

The chatbot uses a local files `data/knowledge.json` and `data/memory.json` to look up knowledge based on keywords in the user's message.

Example entry:

```json
{
  "python": {
    "knowledge": "Python is a high-level programming language used for AI, automation, and data science."
  },
  "pepe": {
    "knowledge": "Pepe is a friend of the user. He loves science fiction and has a black cat."
  }
}
```

You can expand this file with your own knowledge entries or give definitions to the chatbot during your conversations. The chatbot will automatically include the most relevant fact in its response generation.

## Model Configuration

In `config.py`, you can tweak generation parameters like:
