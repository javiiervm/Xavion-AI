Xavion AI is a powerful local-first assistant that runs entirely on your machine via Ollama and LangChain. It can help you solve questions, generate or translate text, solve math problems step by step, and generate code. The final idea for this project is that Xavion can be used as a chatbot, a terminal programming agent, or a voice assistant.

- Powered by **Ollama + LangChain** using the `llama3.1` model by default, but easily replaceable with other models.
- Centralized prompting with `instruction` + `knowledge` + `conversation_history` blocks and intent detection helpers.

Below you can find information about each specific version and what it is better for, and you can get the app easily by clicking on the name of any of its variants. Check the `README` and requirements to run each variant.
